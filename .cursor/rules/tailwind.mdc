# 🧱 Avoid Duplicating **className** in Reusable Components

Before creating a new component in Figma, **check if it already exists**. For example, if you need a button, look for the `Button` component.

Avoid manually adding `className` with styles such as `border-radius` (`rounded-md`), `color` (`text-white`, `text-gray-800`), `background-color` (`bg-blue-600`, `bg-red-500`), `padding` (`px-4`, `py-2`, `p-3`), `font-size` (`text-sm`, `text-lg`), etc., if these styles are **already included in the component** (e.g., `Button`) through its variants — they are **already part of the internally generated `className`**.

> 🎯 If the style is already present in the variant, it **will be reflected in the generated `className`**, and **does not need to be manually reapplied**.

## ❌ Incorrect (repeating already existing styles)

The `Button` component was used, but styles were manually reapplied via `className`, which is redundant and may lead to inconsistencies:

```tsx
<Button className="bg-blue-600 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-md font-medium">
  Salvar
</Button>
```

## ✅ Correct (using the variant with a clean className)

When using the Button component with the primary variant, there's no need to reapply styles. The internally generated className already includes the visual tokens:

```tsx
<Button variant="primary">
  Salvar
</Button>
```
